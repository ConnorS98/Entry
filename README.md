Entry makes use of a cardview-type layout to display multiple custom lists. Each card contains a user-uploaded or default image and the name of the list. When selected, the card then leads to a view of a custom list that can have items added or removed from it. Lists will have default catagores for the user to choose from to catagorize items/tasks within the list.

## Features
1. Ability to have multiple custom lists
2. Built-in catagories for simple organization
